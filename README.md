# Silksong-Boss-Respawner
A simple (UI'less) BepInEx mod for HollowKnight Silksong that respawns the bosses of silksong for practice purposes. The intention is to use this mod for Speedrun and Steel Soul practice, allowing you to easily respawn bosses while still in game, so you don't need to roll back your save or edit save files.
